      <h2>Conceptual Response</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, I created a web based audio player that follows an all
        text character/skeumorphism theme. This prototype explores different
        visual elements by using text characters to create a UI that mimics a
        retro car radio. The audio player features different elements such as a
        scrolling track displau, an EQ visualiser, and different buttons that
        control the audio player. The prototype also adapts to the time of day
        by changing the audio to match the different moods of the day.

          The project is inspired by the design of a retro car radio (Figure 1).
          I had the idea of creating it after remembering my mom's old car that
          had the exact same radio system, and i wanted to recreate that. The
          design of the radio player fits the ASCII theme and i also planned on
          implementing a mood changing feature that changes the audio based on
          the time of day by utilising Date.now to change the pitch and filter
          of the audio.

        <p id="sketch">
          The design also includes a scrolling track display that mimics the LED
          display of the car radio, an EQ visualiser that uses different text
          characters to represent different levels, and buttons that control the
          audio player such as play/pause, stop, loop, and mute. The overall
          design is meant to be nostalgic and fun while also being functional.

      <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

      <h3>
        <strong>UI Rendering</strong>
      </h3>

      <img src="flow-diagram.jpg" alt="" />
      <figcaption id="flow-diagramfig">

      </figcaption>

      <p>
        The UI for this project isn’t built with standard HTML but is rendered
        entirely using ASCII characters within a single
        <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> block. Using JavaScript instead of HTML allows
        for more interactive features like live EQ visualization, scrolling
        track names, and responsive playback controls. By updating the ASCII-art
        interface as a single string, it improves performance during updates,
        and simplifies state management since all UI elements reflect the
        current application state. It also naturally achieves the retro,
        terminal-inspired aesthetic through monospaced text and box-drawing
        characters rendered in a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> element.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <strong>Date.Now Implementation</strong>
      </h3>

      <div class="date-row">
        <div class="date-text">
          <p>
            Another feature I added is implementing Date.now to check the
            system’s date and time to modify the audio. By checking the time,
            the audio player modifies parameters like pitch and filters to
            reflect different moods throughout the day—for instance, brighter
            tones in the morning and warmer, softer sounds at night. This
            date-based logic not only creates a context-aware and responsive
            listening experience but also adds personalization and variety,
            making the project feel more interactive while still fully contained
            within the ASCII-art interface.

      <h2>Reflection (Week 8 Peer Testing)</h2>
      <p>
        After receiving the feedback from Wednesday's testing session, the
        general consensus was that users liked the design of the prototype but
        had some problems with the limited interactions and minimal visual
        elements. From this feedback, I plan to add more animations,
        interactions and visual elements to add more depth to the prototype.
        Some users also mentioned problems with the audio ( not playing, delayed
        start ), and also with the volume bar. I plan on to edit the audio so
        that it can flow better and also add more hints for the buttons used for
        interactions, to reduce confusion. The main feedback was to add more
        depth to the protoype, and to refine the interactions to make it more
        user friendly without losing the feel of the retro ASCII theme. I will
        implement these changes for the next assignment to create a more
        finished product and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.
